        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Albert Einstein's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mar 14, 1879</strong> - Albert Einstein is born in Ulm,
            Germany, the son of Hermann Einstein, a German-Jewish featherbed
            salesman, and his wife Pauline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1884</strong> - At the age of five, Albert Einstein becomes
            fascinated by his father's pocket compass, intrigued by invisible
            forces that cause the needle always to point north. Later in life,
            Einstein will look back at this moment as the genesis of his
            interest in science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1894</strong> - Struggling financially, the Einstein family
            moves from Germany to Italy in search of better work. Albert, aged
            fifteen, stays behind in Munich to finish his schooling, but soon
            either quits or is kicked out of his high school and follows his
            parents to Italy.

            Swiss Polytechnic University in Zurich. He fails the test, forcing
            him to attend one final year of high school in the small town of
            Aarau, Switzerland, instead.

          <li>
            <strong>1896</strong> - At the age of 17, Albert Einstein renounces

          <li>
            <strong>1900</strong> - Albert Einstein graduates from ETH with a
            degree in physics. He tries to find a teaching job, but is unable to

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1902</strong> - Milena Maric gives birth to Leiserl
            Einstein, Albert's first child. The unwed couple, unable to care for

            Einstein publishes four major theoretical papers in the prestigious
            German academic journal Annalen Der Physik. The four papers include
            a groundbreaking new interpretation of the photoelectric effect (for
            which Einstein will eventually win the Nobel Prize) as well as the
            first published exploration of the theory of Special Relativity and
            the first formulation of the famous equation e=mc2.
