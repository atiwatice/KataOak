            Germany is closing all its nuclear power plants. Now it must find a
            place to bury the deadly waste for 1 million years
          </h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to the big questions plaguing the world's scientists,
            they don't get much larger than this. Where do you safely bury more
            than 28,000 cubic meters -- roughly six Big Ben clock towers -- of
            deadly radioactive waste for the next million years? This is the
            "wicked problem" facing Germany as it closes all of its nuclear
            power plants in the coming years, according to Professor Miranda
            Schreurs, part of the team searching for a storage site. Experts are
            now hunting for somewhere to bury almost 2,000 containers of
            high-level radioactive waste. The site must be beyond rock-solid,
            with no groundwater or earthquakes that could cause a leakage. The
            technological challenges -- of transporting the lethal waste,
            finding a material to encase it, and even communicating its
            existence to future humans -- are huge. But the most pressing
            challenge today might simply be finding a community willing to have
            a nuclear dumping ground in their backyard.

          <h2>This country with a colonial history has a blackface problem</h2>
          <p>
            When the festive figure Sinterklaas rolled through the Dutch town of
            Apeldoorn in November, he was greeted by TV crews, cheering crowds,
            and an inevitable round of furious protests. The anger was not
            directed at Sinterklaas himself, whose annual "arrival" festival
            marks the start of the Christmas season in the country. It was aimed
            at his sidekick, Black Pete -- whose appearance in blackface, a
            curly afro wig and red lipstick divides the country on an annual
            basis. But while controversies over the continued existence of Black
            Pete in the Netherlands have become as well-established a tradition
            as the character itself, one if its bordering nations is yet to hold
            a reckoning over its own relationship with blackface. Belgium has a
            blackface problem. The country shares in the Black Pete tradition,
            albeit less enthusiastically than the Netherlands. But around
            Belgium, few seasons pass without folkloric festivals revolving
            around characters in the racist garb -- and while its use has become
            polarizing around the world, Belgium has a casual approach to the
            tradition that is jarring to many outsiders. It's an attitude that
            goes back generations to Belgium's colonial era, say experts -- and
            a 21st century reappraisal seems some distance away.

            Impeachment shows unelected government employees are heart of
            democracy
          </h2>
          <p>
            The depositions began on October 17 and were followed, less than a
            month later, by the televised public hearings of the House
            Intelligence Committee. By November 21, the nation had heard, live
            and in person, from 11 unelected career public servants and one
            recent Trump-appointee, hotelier Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to
            the European Union. The testimony followed the allegations of an
            unelected government whistleblower that the president and other top
            government officials had pressured foreign nations, primarily
            Ukraine, to investigate former Vice President and 2020 presidential
            candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The Trump administration
            directed these (and other) individuals not to testify, according to
            The Washington Post. But some, including Sondland — who had secured
            an appointment as EU ambassador after contributing over $1 million
            to Trump's inaugural committee — came forward after subpoena without
            challenging the writ in court, as others in the administration have.
